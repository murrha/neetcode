* create a linked list grouping odd indices and even indices together -> not the value but rather the positions of the linked list
* they cannot be out of order
* **tc: O(n)
* sc: O(1)**
​
* constant space complexity -> reorder the linked list to make it fit the conditions stated for the problem
* order n time complexity -> traverse through the list in order to get the final output
​
* how am I going to figure out what are the odd and even indices? -> two pointer approach: odd and even values
